**Summary**  
SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 and nsp4 can induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles to package viral RNA inside. They purified the DMVs using a TwinStrep-EGFP tag on nsp3 by transfecting Expi293F cells. They collected 4,000 tomograms and obtained the pore complex structure using subtomogram averaging (STA). The structure looks nice, but I believe single-particle analysis would be a better approach for solving this structure.

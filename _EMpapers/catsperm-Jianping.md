**Summary**  
They engineered 3Ã—FLAG-EGFP-TEV-CATSPER1 knock-in mice using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Testes and epididymides were homogenized, and the CatSper complex was purified using GST-GFP nanobodies and anti-FLAG resins. This approach enabled the isolation of the entire CatSper complex and the identification of novel protein components within it.

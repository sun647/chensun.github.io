**Journal:** *BioRxiv*  

**Method**  
Cryo-ET   

**Summary**  
They incubated two potent IgG antibodies with SARS-CoV2 virion and found 1) both antibodies can dimerize the spike trimers; 2) one antibody crosslink the spike trimers into rings on the virus membrane, while the other antibody crosslink the spike trimers into lines.

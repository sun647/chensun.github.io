excerpt: 'In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using a single position on the Volta Phase Plate (VPP) and examined its impact on image quality and phase shift distribution. Two cryo-EM datasets were collected—one with phase shifts ranging from 0–180°, and another extending to 0–360°. Both datasets yielded high-resolution reconstructions of apoferritin. Our results demonstrate that images with large phase shifts remain suitable for high-resolution structure determination, highlighting the robustness and flexibility of VPP imaging strategies.'

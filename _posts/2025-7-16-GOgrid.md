If you're struggling with poor Graphene Oxide (GO) coverage on cryo-EM grids, this simple protocol can help you achieve nearly 100% coverage. I use an adapted version of Dr. Thomas G. Martin’s protocol, originally shared [here on Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/media/Graphene_Oxide_Grid_Preparation/3178669?file=5029150).

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### 1. Prepare Pyrene Stock Solution
Make a **5 mM pyrene stock** by dissolving **20 mg of pyrene** into **20 mL of methanol**.  
Store at room temperature in the dark.

### 2. Glow Discharge the Grids
Use a glow discharger to treat Quantifoil or C-Flat grids. This improves hydrophilicity and helps both pyrene and GO adhere more uniformly to the surface.

### 3. Pyrene Coating
Apply **3 μL of 0.5 mM pyrene** solution to the carbon side of each grid.  
Let it **incubate for 1 minute** at RT. 

### 4. Graphene Oxide Application
Dilute **2 mg/mL GO (Sigma 763705)** to **0.2 mg/mL in deionized water**.  
Apply **3 μL** of the diluted GO solution to the grid.  
**Incubate for 2 minutes.**  
*Tip: Longer incubation times often lead to better coverage.*

### 5. Water Rinsing on Parafilm
Prepare **three drops of deionized water** on a piece of parafilm:
- Blot the **front** of the grid by gently touching it to the **first two drops**.
- Blot the **back** of the grid with the **third drop** to allow GO adhere to the grid.

### 6. Air Dry and Store
Allow the grid to **air dry completely**.  
Once dry, store the GO-coated grids in a grid box.  
They can be **kept for years** without degradation if stored in a clean, dry environment.

## Final Notes

This protocol consistently yields graphene oxide grids with excellent coverage. Adjusting the GO concentration and incubation time can fine-tune results for your specific application.

Happy grid-making!

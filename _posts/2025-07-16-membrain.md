## Step 1: Install [MemBrain-Seg](https://github.com/teamtomo/membrain-seg?tab=readme-ov-file)

Clone the GitHub repository and follow the instructions in the README to install dependencies and set up the Python environment:

## Step 2: Select a Specific GPU

To specify which GPU to use, prepend your MemBrain command with the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable. This variable tells PyTorch which GPU(s) are visible to the program. You can run multiple MemBrain commands in parallel on different GPUs to process several tomograms simultaneously.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 membrain segment --tomogram-path lamella4_ts_001_full_rec.mrc --ckpt-path /home/csun/Membrain-model/MemBrain_seg_v10_alpha.ckpt --store-connected-components
```
